ðŸŽ¬ MERN Movie Management App â€“ Developed as part of my Frontend Development subject this semester.

This project is a movie management application where users can:
- Add, edit, and delete movies
- Mark movies as favorites
- View a personalized profile with stats on their added and favorite movies

This was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of React and frontend development while integrating it with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js for a complete MERN stack experience.

I applied key concepts like state management, RESTful API integration, and component-based architecture to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.
